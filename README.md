### **Objectives**

- **Streamline Access to Professor and Grade Data**: Integrate Rate My Professors data and grade distribution information into the Clemson class signup page.
- **Reduce Workflow Hassles**: Simplify the process of deciding which classes to take by providing critical data directly on the signup page.

### **Accomplishments**

- **Created a Chrome Extension Icon**: Utilized GPT-4 to design an icon for the Chrome extension.
- **Data Extraction**: Employed Tabula to convert Clemson grade distribution PDFs into workable CSV files.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Practiced debugging the Chrome extension by loading it unpacked and utilizing the Chrome Web Developer Tools console.

### **Current Challenges**

- **Access to Grade Distribution Data**: Clemson has disabled the ability to download grade distribution PDFs over the past year, limiting the availability of the most recent data in CSV format.

By addressing these challenges and continuing to refine the extension, the goal is to make the class selection process as efficient and informed as possible for Clemson students.
