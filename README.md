## **IRoar Premium**

### **Objectives**

- **Streamline Access to Professor and Grade Data**: Integrate Rate My Professors data and grade distribution information into the Clemson class signup page.
- **Reduce Workflow Hassles**: Simplify the process of deciding which classes to take by providing critical data directly on the signup page.

### **Accomplishments**

- **Created a Chrome Extension Icon**: Utilized GPT-4 to design an icon for the Chrome extension.
- **Data Extraction**: Sent a data inquiry to the Office of Institutional Research to get the latest grade distribution reports posted properly with download capabilities.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Practiced debugging the Chrome extension by loading it unpacked and utilizing the Chrome Web Developer Tools console.
- **Prettify**: Removed some text I deemed unnecessary from the teacher listings and also added css styling to the div that contained that text to make sure my ratings and such would wrap instead of overflowing even on a smaller screen.

### **Current Challenges**

- **Implementing Grade Distributions**: Need to pull the info from the CSV or provide a external link to make it easy to see grade distributions alongside the professor ratings inside iroar. 

By addressing these challenges and continuing to refine the extension, the goal is to make the class selection process as efficient and informed as possible for Clemson students.
