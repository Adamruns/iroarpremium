The goal of this project is to be able to view rate my professors data and grade distribution data efficiently on the clemson class signup page to reduce the workflow and hassle needed to decide what class is best to take.


I created a picture for the chrome extension using GPT 4
Used Tabula to turn clemson grade distribution pdfs into csvs that I could work with
Practiced debugging the chrome extension by loading it unpacked and with the console
in chrome web dev tools

Right now one of the main problems with the grade distributions is that clemson
has turned off the ability to download the pdfs the past year so I am not able
to have CSVs of that info obviously.
